<div style="background-image:url('/pix/samples/bg1.gif');
	background-repeat:repeat;
	background-attachment:fixed;
	overflow:scroll;
	width:200px;
	height:100px;">
  <p>This example shows how a background image can be set to a fixed position, even though its containing block scrolls. This is achieved with the <a href="/css/properties/css_background-attachment.cfm"><code>background-attachment</code></a> property.</p>
</div>
